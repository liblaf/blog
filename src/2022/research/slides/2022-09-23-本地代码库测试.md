## 本地代码库测试

> 2022-09-23

---

## Progress

- refactor `logging` utility: support `LOG_LEVEL`
- improve `Makefile`
- NDK setup scripts at [liblaf/dotfiles](https://github.com/liblaf/dotfiles/tree/main/ubuntu/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/pkg/ndk)
  - install NDK release
  - install prebuilt clang ( with LLVM headers )

--

### TODO

- wrap custom compiler with a bash script to setup necessary environment variables ( `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` )

---

## ijkplayer with ASan

SEGV on unknown address ( discussed [last week](/slides/2022/09/16/本地代码库测试/#/2) ) is probably caused by READ memory access to internal address of JVM. However, JVM is not compiled with ASan. Therefore ASan identify the address as an unknown address.

## How to build Telegram

[How to Build Telegram for Android](/android/2022/09/21/how-to-build-telegram-for-android/)

## Telegram with ASan

Telegram depends on some **prebuilt static libraries**. However, ASan requires a **shared build**. I haven't find a way to use ASan yet.

## Telegram Build Failed with Custom Compiler

```log
:TMessagesProj:buildCMakeDebug
cstdio:134:9: error: no member named 'fgetpos' in the global namespace; did you mean 'fgets'?
cstdio:136:9: error: no member named 'fsetpos' in the global namespace
...
```

--

```log
:TMessagesProj_App:mergeAfatDebugJniLibFolders
...
Caused by: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: jni/voip/tgcalls/LogSinkImpl.cpp-7e5656bf.ll.tmp
...
```

### Possible Solutions

- output `*.ll` elsewhere
- remove `*.ll` immediately after compliation
